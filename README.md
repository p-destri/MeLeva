This project was developed as personal idea with Andre Amaru (coul not find his GH) while working at [PET-MA](http://www.petma.com.br/v6/).

Me Leva was a open source Car pool app, for any student at UFSC (Federal University of Santa Catarina) to use. The app used the university oAuth to log in, providing more
safety for users.

Unfortunetly, the app is not online anymore, since the university put down some of the services that were being used.
